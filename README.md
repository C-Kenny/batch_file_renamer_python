## Preemptive Measures:
  1. Check that Python3.x is installed on your system
  2. Download rename_CK.py and place it the folder where you would like to modify the file names
  
## Usage:
`$ python rename_CK.py`

## TODO:
- Add a step confirming the files to be renamed
- Add CLI argument of folder path to search from
- Maybe move the files to /tmp/ instead of deleting them in-case things get crazy
